# oop-and-visual-programming

This is one of the tasks that I completed in the object-oriented programming lesson at Dokuz Eylul University, and I also added a visual interface from what we learned in the visual programming lesson

In short, it is a simulation of a race between some objects. The objects moves based on randomly generated simulations and affect each other, such as a fox hunting an ostrich or an elephant striking an ostrich, etc.,
int task i used:
1- Concepts of inheritance, interface, polymorphism, and encapsulation were used
2 - The interface was created by Windows Form and the contestants were represented by pictures that were animated similar to the objects
